## Day Light 

Day Light is an iOS app (Swift 4) that tracks daily sunrises and sunsets so you can see how much day light you have left. This  side-project is ongoing. 

Implemented using 
- Dark Sky API (Weather/ Forecasting data)
- WXKDarkSky (Swift wrapper for Dark Sky)
- Apple Libraries (CoreData, MapKit, Foundation)
- Postman for verifying endpoints

## To do 
- MapKit for improved location search queries
- graphics for sunrising/ setting/ current pos in sky
- Pull in ISS data to determing its visibility for given location http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/

Later on:
- history/ future search 
- iOS widget 
- weekly table of aggregate data
